## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Surviving Titanic (R)] (https://github.com/etna9088/surviving_titanic)
Analyzed the Titanic dataset in R to explore survival patterns and built logistic regression models, achieving improved accuracy by incorporating variables like age, class, and gender.

### 🔹 [Car Prices (R)] (https://github.com/etna9088/car_prices)
Built linear regression models in R to predict car prices using variables like mileage, engine size, brand, and car type. Improved model accuracy from 33% to 94% by incorporating categorical variables, and visualized trends with ggplot2 and interactive 3D plots.

### 🔹 [Bank Account Depletion Simulation (MATLAB)] (https://github.com/etna9088/week_12)
Simulated a high-interest bank account in MATLAB to model balance changes with monthly interest, bimonthly withdrawals, and annual deposits. Used conditionals and loops to track account depletion and visualized the outcome with a time-series plot.

### 🔹 [Area Estimation Projects (MATLAB)] (https://github.com/etna9088/area_panels)
Implemented numerical integration in MATLAB to estimate the area under different curves using the trapezoidal rule. Compared accuracy by varying the number of panels for both a parabolic function and the absolute sine function over a full cycle.
