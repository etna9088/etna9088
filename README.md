### The Return on Investment of a College Degree

This project investigates the relationship between college costs and graduates' median earnings 10 years after enrolling in college using data from the U.S. Department of Education. I used **exploratory data analysis** and a **linear regression model** to examine how the average cost of attendance predicts future earnings. The analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship, though the model's R-squared value of 34.4% suggests other factors heavily influence graduate earnings.

**Key Skills:** R (`tidyverse`, `broom`, `infer`, `modelr`), Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Linear Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Residual Diagnostics, Predictive Modeling, Git/GitHub

**Key Finding:** The analysis found a statistically significant positive relationship, suggesting that higher college costs are associated with higher graduate earnings, though cost alone does not fully explain the variation.
