## Featured Projects

#### 1. The Return on Investment of a College Degree

This project investigates the relationship between college costs and graduates' median earnings 10 years after enrolling in college using data from the U.S. Department of Education. I used **exploratory data analysis** and a **linear regression model** to examine how the average cost of attendance predicts future earnings. The analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship, though the model's R-squared value of 34.4% suggests other factors heavily influence graduate earnings.

**Key Skills:** R (`tidyverse`, `broom`, `infer`, `modelr`), Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Linear Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Residual Diagnostics, Predictive Modeling, Git/GitHub

**Key Finding:** The analysis found a statistically significant positive relationship, suggesting that higher college costs are associated with higher graduate earnings, though cost alone does not fully explain the variation.

#### 2. Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to accurately estimate the retail price of used General Motors (GM) cars. Using a dataset from the **2005 Central Edition of the Kelly Blue Book**, I performed **exploratory data analysis** and built a **linear regression model** to determine which vehicle features have the most significant impact on price. The analysis revealed that while mileage is a factor, a car's make and type are far more influential, with the final model explaining over **94% of the price variability**.

**Key Skills:** R (`tidyverse`, `broom`, `infer`, `modelr`, `readxl`), Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Linear Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Residual Diagnostics, Predictive Modeling, Git/GitHub

**Key Findidng:** The project found that categorical features like a car's **make, type**, and **cylinder** are the most significant factors in determining its price, with a mixed model incorporating these variables achieving an R-squared value of 0.94.
